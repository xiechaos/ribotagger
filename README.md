# RiboTagger

RiboTagger is composed of a few scripts. The main script is called ribotagger.pl, 
which scans one or more fastq/fasta files to extract sequences from a particular variable 
region and report estimated observations for each reported sequences due to sequencing error. 
Each of your samples need to be scanned individually by this script. 
Then there is a script biom.pl to combine the output files from ribotagger.pl and produces a number
of output files, including a few tabular files and a BIOM formated file.
The tabular files can be used for your 16S/18S profiling analysis, while the BIOM file can be directly
used by tools like QIIME.

Please check the poster.pdf for an overview of the package. For more details, please read the official publication at https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1378-x

## Example Runs
### Sample data
You need to downaload and unpack the <a href="http://137.132.19.92/cnv/samples.tar.gz">sample data file</a>. You should see 5 fastq files in the "test" folder. 
### Test Runs

```
> mkdir out
> ribotagger.pl -r v4 -i test/samp1.fq -o out/samp1.v4 
```

The structure of the output
```
> head out/samp1.v4 
	#By:    RiboTagger v0.8.0 (PSSM: 2014-08-01)
	#Date:  2014-08-23T20:23:05

```

The output is a table file with the following fields:
-  *tag*: the tag sequence for the variable region
-  *n*: the number of reads that contains this tag
-  *npos*: the number of different locations of the tag on their source reads (big value of column "n" with small value of "npos" indicates duplicated reads or amplicon sequencing data)
-  *fp*: the number of reads you would expect to see this tag due to sequencing errors alone
-  *long.total.count*: the number of reads containing a longer sequence of this tag (see the -long option)
-  *long1.count*, *long2.count*, *long3.count*: number of reads containing the most abundant variants of this tag's long sequences (low long1.count/long.total.count ratio indicates that this tag is very likely repressenting a mixture of "species")
-  *long1*, *long2*: the most abundant long representive sequences of this tag

If you have more than one files composing one sample (say pair end reads), and you want to make one ribotag report for this sample, you can supply multiple files for the -i or -in option:
```
> ribotagger.pl -r v4 -i test/samp2_1.fq test/samp2_2.fq -o out/samp2.v4 
```

You can also use compressed files as input. Both gzip and bzip2 are supported. However, tar.gz or tar are NOT supported.
```
> ribotagger.pl -r v4 -i test/samp3.fq.gz -o out/samp3.v4
> ribotagger.pl -r v4 -i test/samp4.fq.gz -o out/samp4.v4
```

Make summary table files and a BIOM file for all your four samples:
```
> ls -lh out
	total 252K
	-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao 64K 2014-08-23 20:23 samp1.v4
	-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao 67K 2014-08-23 20:25 samp2.v4
	-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao 57K 2014-08-23 20:26 samp3.v4
	-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao 60K 2014-08-23 20:27 samp4.v4

> biom.pl -r v4 -i out/samp*.v4 -o out/my.sample
```

Then you will see 4 files in your out folder:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao  56K 2014-09-04 17:05 my.sample.anno
-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao 132K 2014-09-04 17:05 my.sample.biom
-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao  16K 2014-09-04 17:05 my.sample.tab
-rw-r--r-- 1 xiechao xiechao  71K 2014-09-04 17:05 my.sample.xls
```

The *.tab file contains the ribotag abundance (raw count) in each sample. 
The *.anno file contains the annotation of each ribotag (only available if you are using default -tag and -long option for ribotagger.pl). The fileds in this file are as follows:
- *tag*: the ribotag sequence
- *use*: "tag" or "long", whether the annotation was based on the short tag or long representive sequence
- *taxon_level*: taxa rank of this annotation of this tag
- *taxon_data*: taxa rank of the most specific annotation appeared in the database (silva or greengenes) for this tag
- *long*: the long representive sequence of this tag
- *long_total*: the number of samples having any long representive sequence
- *long_this*: the number of samples having this long sequence as its major representive of this tag
- *support*: the number of database sequences having this this tag or long sequence
- *confidence*: the proportion of the database sequences agreed on this annotation
- *k, p, c, o, f, g, s*: annotation for each of the taxa ranks - kingdom/domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species
The *.xls file is the combination of the *.tab and *.anno files. <br>
The *.biom file can be used by QIIME. 

From the above files, you can carry on with your usual community profiling routine. For example, PCoA analysis using the provided R script:
```
> pcoa.r out/my.sample.tab out/my.sample.pcoa
```
We also provide a batch script to do all the above steps after ribotagger.pl:
```
batch.pl -r v4 -i out/samp*.v4 -o out/my.sample
```
Then check your folder out/my.sample.

There are many options can be tweaked for both ribotagger.pl and biom.pl (see the last section of this page for detailed references).
Or if you want to use RiboTagger to do more creative things, the following commands for ribotagger.pl might be useful for you:
